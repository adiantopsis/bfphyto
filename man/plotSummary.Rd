\usage{
plotSummary(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the columns: plots (\code{parc}), species (\code{spp}), height (\code{H}), and either diameters (\code{dap}) or circumferences (\code{cap}).}
}
\value{
A list summarizing the data for each sampling unit, including:
\itemize{
\item Abundance
\item Richness (removing dead specimens is recommended to avoid counting them here)
\item Shannon-Wiener diversity index (in nats)
\item Mean and standard deviation of height (in meters)
\item Mean and standard deviation of DBH or CBH (in cm)
\item Pielou's evenness index
\item Basal area (in mÂ²)
}

\description{
Function to summarize forest inventory data by sampling unit
}
\details{
This function summarizes forest inventory data, requiring the following packages: \code{reshape}, \code{tidyverse}, and \code{vegan}.

The input file must contain the following columns with exact lowercase names:
\itemize{
\item \code{parc}: plot identification (numeric or character, either works)
\item \code{spp}: common or scientific name of the individual
\item \code{dap}: diameter at breast height (DBH) in cm
or
\item \code{cap}: circumference at breast height (CBH) in cm
\item \code{H}: height in meters
}

It is advisable to use separate columns for individuals with multi-stemmed trunks, named as: \code{cap} or \code{dap1}, \code{dap2}, \code{dap3}, \code{dap4}, etc. Alternatively, use the equivalent diameter. Do NOT separate the stems of individuals into rows.

Note: The script will search for the keywords \code{cap} and \code{dap} in column names to locate them. Therefore, avoid having extra columns containing these keywords in their names (e.g., a column named \code{dap_medio} could cause calculation errors).
